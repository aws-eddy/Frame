Frame:
A programming language that will dramatically increase the speed at which web interfaces are developed

Frame uses parser combinators to create an abstract syntax tree of the input which is translated into HTML, allowing for much faster web interface prototyping. For examples, syntax rules and a discussion of the potential uses, see **Documentation/framespec.pdf** for a detailed language definition.
